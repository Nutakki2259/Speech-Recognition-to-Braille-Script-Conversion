# Speech Recognition to Louis Braille Script Conversion
### The conversion of the voice through Google speech recognition is converted into Louis Braille  through Python programming.

## 1. Initial Prerequisites
Install speech recognition using `pip install SpeechRecognition` and
Install pybraille using `pip install pybraille`

## 2. Convert the Speech into Text
The speech from the speaker is converted into text using the inbuilt microphone of the computer [1,2].
The speech is recognized through Google recognition technique [1].

## 3. Convert the Text to Louis Braille Script
The converted text is then transformed into the dot format of the Louis Braille script using pybraille library [2].

## 4. Data Saving into a Text File
The data from the voice and the converted Braille script is saved as a text file.

## 5. Future Scope
The improvements on the process and application of the code in daily usage.
